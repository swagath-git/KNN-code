# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model – Machine Learning Project
# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and optimization of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python and Scikit-learn.
The notebook explores data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation to identify the most optimal K-value for accurate predictions.

# Features
1. Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Model training with multiple hyperparameter configurations
3. Use of GridSearchCV for parameter optimization
4. Performance analysis using metrics such as accuracy, R² score, and confusion matrix
5. Clean, modular, and reproducible code for educational and practical use

# Technologies Used
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
4. Scikit-learn (sklearn)

# Key Steps
1. Data Loading and Exploration – Load dataset and analyze key features
2. Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features
3. Model Implementation – Apply KNN for classification/regression tasks
4. Hyperparameter Tuning – Use GridSearchCV to find the best n_neighbors value
5. Model Evaluation – Compare performance metrics and visualize results

# Results
1. Achieved optimal model accuracy through parameter tuning
2. Identified best-performing random state and neighbor value
3. Demonstrated clear performance improvement through cross-validation
